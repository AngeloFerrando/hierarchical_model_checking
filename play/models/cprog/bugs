bug1:

The property (AF pc = ERROR3) in instrumented.c works with niether of the refiners (new and csp1).

Well, it shouldn't work!

bug2: 

On tests: test9.c, test19.c, the model checker should terminate. 

OK!

bug3:

EF pc = END on blast/tut6.c does not return true! I guess the reason is that
we don;t abstract the conditions in while and if-stmts appropriately.
