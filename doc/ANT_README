Use ant for:

To run ant you need to specify the location of the build.xml file, so
you type somehting like:
ant -f $ROOT/build.xml

Right now ant has the following targets:
1) compile (default target) - compiles all that needs to be compiled
2) clean - removes all the .class files except for the ones that
belong to the CTL parser
3) rebuild = clean + compile
4) buildlib - builds the giant .jar file of all the libraries we use
5) dist - builds a .jar file which contains all the libraries we use
and our own classes
6) realclean -- removes all ANTLR generated files + clean
